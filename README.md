## üîë API Key Setup

This app requires an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch data.

1.  Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
2.  Create a file named **`.env.local`** in the root of the project directory.
3.  Add your API key to the file in this format:
    ```
    VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_GOES_HERE
    ```

*(Commit the code after adding the README, but **never commit your API key** or the `.env.local` file itself!)*
